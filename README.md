Requires Visual Studios 2013 or newer. Procedutex is a library that compiles into static libraries (.lib files). These lib files are tested in separate projects called ProcedutexTestWindow and DemoEngine.

The ProcedutexTestWindow is a simple window showing 4 textures made with the procedural library. The test engine is a custom C++ game engine that was being made from another academic project to test Procedutex on 3D objects. For the DemoEngine project, it is recommended to run on Release mode; the program takes too long to load on Debug mode.
